<p>It was a summer night at Winnebago camp reservation, and the sun had just set. Crowded around a fire pit was a group of CITs very focused on building a fire for their campsite. Amongst this group was me. Everyone debated about how we should build the fire. All the arguing distracted us, and we did not realize who drove up.</p>

<p>His name was Derek. His face was covered in stubble that looked very nonuniform from an uneven shave. He was wearing a hat pulled down over his face so it was hard to see his eyes. Between the stubble and his hat, you could see a scar running down the right side of his face. There were many stories about where he got that scar, but when asked all he did was glare at you. He was accompanied by the smell of smoke from the cigarette in his hand. Derek lived at the camp year round. As far as anyone knew he had no family. Over the years the isolation turned him sour. He was not someone to be messed with. We saw Derek here and there and knew enough to leave him alone. He patrolled the woods in his ATV looking for anyone he thought disrespecting his woods. On this evening his unfortunate victim happened to be us. He got off his ATV and slowly walked up to us with this scary look on his face.</p>

<p>Derek looked around for a second to see if there was anything he did not like. He fixed his gaze on me. I felt like my stomach was turned upside down. All he said was, "Your fire is too big." He glared the others around me. I though the eerie silence would never end. He left without another word. It was like something out of a horror movie. Trembling, we all gave one another a look of terror. I think Riley peed himself, but it was too dark to tell. After that, we lost interest in the fire.</p>

<p>It was the end of a long day, so I started getting ready for bed. Since the rest of the camp was packed full of campers and we were CITs, we were stuck in the run down lean-tos. They were like two abandoned cabins that were missing a side. The lean-tos themselves weren't that bad, but what lived in them was unpleasant. They were full of cobwebs and other unidentifiable creatures. One of them had a family of groundhogs living under it that would make strange noises at night. The missing side left us exposed to the rest of the camp with no privacy. There was a latrine a couple hundred feet away, which was really just a toilet and a sink in the middle of the woods, which the camp had graciously given to us. </p>

<p>I grabbed my toothbrush and my flashlight, to get ready for bed. I turned to face the open side of the lean-to, and a chill ran down my spine. All I saw was dozens of glowing eyes fixed on me. I stopped not knowing what to do. Everyone else was in the other lean-to trying to scare away the groundhog. I was left alone. I focused on the creature nearest me and tried to think of which animals had eyes like. Was it an animal I wanted to be visited by, in the middle of the night? I tried to catch a glimpse of the beast, but my flashlight was not that good. My eyes strained to make out the furry shape of a raccoon only a few paces away. All I could think of were those eyes staring back at me. I turned the light off and jumped into my bed. I tried not to think of those eyes still fixated on me. Despite being watched, I was pretty tired and, I fell asleep quickly.</p>

<p>A couple hours later I awoke with Dreve calling my name, "Christian, Christian, get up." His voice was a whisper yet stern. I pretended to be asleep in hopes he would go away, but I was about to lose it.</p>

<p>"Christian there is a raccoon under your bed!" he said in a much louder tone than before. At this point, I did not really care what was under my bed - unless it was Derek that would be scary and kinda weird. I kept on ignoring them and tried to go back to sleep. I dozed off for a couple of minutes until Deven got the bright idea to poke the creature with a stick. Horrible noises began to escape from under my bed. Sounds that would send chills down the bravest man's spine. I sat up and looked at them in a state of confusion.</p>

<p>"What the hell are you guys doing!?!" They had a startled look on their face like they were just now considering how bad of an idea this was. It is amazing how an idea can seem so smart one second then so stupid the next. I look around the cabin trying to see what was going on. My eyes finally got used to the small amount of light in the lean-to, and I saw an open cooler full of Arizona in the middle of the lean-to. It was then that I lost it.</p>

<p>"WHAT WERE YOU GUYS THINKING! NO WONDER THESE CREATURES KEEP COMING BACK! YOUR COOLER IS LIKE A BEACON TO EVERY ANIMAL IN THE FOREST!" We were all distracted and did not see the second raccoon creep into the cabin. Just as it caught my eye, it grabbed Dreve's bag in its teeth and bolted. Everyone was laughing hysterically except for Dreve who darted right after the raccoon. He chased that thing into the forest like his life depended on it. Out of breath and gasping for air Dreve finally came back panting, with his bag in hand. After that, the raccoons left us alone. Maybe they gave up or had mercy on us. Most likely they moved to the next campsite to torment more little children.</p>

<p>We all learned a valuable lesson that day. We learned why you do not keep Arizona Ice Tea in the middle of the woods. We were pretty lucky it was just a couple raccoons and not a bear. Despite our stupidity and that night this was the best summer I have ever had, and looking back, I would not change a thing.</p>
